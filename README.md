# pDLibrary
pDLibrary is a bunch of pure data abstractions and externals. It isn't a library per se. Abstractions in ./abs folder are shared objects. These are vanilla pure data objects if not otherwise stated so it is very easy to include these in your own code and share them. They generally follow the format and state-save standards set out in the famous RjDj rjlib library.
