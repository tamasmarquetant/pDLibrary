# pDLibrary
pDLibrary is a bunch of pure data external objects. It isn't a library per se. Objects in ./abs folder are shared files. These are vanilla pure data objects if not otherwise stated so it is very light to include these in your own code. They generally follow format and state-save standards set out in the famous RjDj framework.

todo/documentation: some helper files are still to be done
